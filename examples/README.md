# Directory of Example Programs for &rho;&mu; Usage

This directory contains programs demonstrating the usage of some of
the functionality of the &rho;&mu; library. 

## Building the Examples

The `pom.xml` in this directory builds the example programs. To build 
the examples, execute the following at the command line with the examples 
directory as your working directory:

```shell
mvn package
```

The requirements for building the examples are the same as for building
the library itself (e.g., Java 17+).

Building the examples will produce a jar file in a target subdirectory of
this examples directory.
